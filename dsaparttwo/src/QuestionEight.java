//8. Fruit Basket Problem
//        Problem Statement
//
//        With a given array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree,
//        place the maximum number of fruits in each of 2 baskets. The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
//
//        You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started. You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e.,
//        you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
//
//        Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.
